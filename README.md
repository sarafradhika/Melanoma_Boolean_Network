# Melanoma_Boolean_Network
This is a boolean representation of the integrated biological cell signaling pathways in metastatic melanoma used in our paper cited below.

Run the file 'boolean_net.m' to generate the figures 15,16,17 and 18 in the paper. 

The files 'boolean_network_function.m' and 'boolean_network_function_nocryp.m' are used as functions and are required to run the 'boolean_net.m' file.
